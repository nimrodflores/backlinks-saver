Backlinks Saver helps you save the link juice from existing backlinks to non-existent pages on your site by redirecting them to the home page with 301 status code.

== Description ==
Based on the greatly useful (for SEO) but long outdated plugin "Link Juice Keeper", *Backlinks Saver* is an updated and simplified version of that SEO plugin. It helps you save the link juice from existing backlinks to non-existent pages on your site by redirecting them to the home page with 301 status code.

If you are optimizing your site for the search engines, you must already know that backlinks are very important and you should make each and every one of them count. But sometimes we make changes to our sites that make some backlinks worthless, changes like:

* Changing the Permalinks Structure for the whole site
* Changing the Permalink of a certain page/post
* Deleting a page/post

The above changes will lead to backlinks being sent to 404 error pages, which tells the search engine bots that those pages don't exist on your site anymore, so your backlinks to those pages won't be counted. But with Backlinks Saver, the links will be sent to the homepage so that they will still count for your domain.
